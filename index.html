            <p class="largetext">My name is James and I am a 24 year old transgender artist based in the North West of England. </p>
            <p>I have been creating for as long as I can remember. Through school I studied both art and graphic design and I did a Level 3 art BTEC in college.</p>
            <p>Art is a form of expression for me. For things I struggle to express with words, I express them with art. Although the majority of what I create is fanart of my interests, it all comes from that same place of self-expression. I want to be able to share that expression with the world, and to do that I wanted to put my favourite works together in one place.</p>
